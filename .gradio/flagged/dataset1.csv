"The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
","1. **Summary:** The lion (Panthera leo) is a large, social cat native to Africa and India, recognizable by its muscular build and, in males, a prominent mane.  Lions live in prides consisting of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. Females typically hunt together, targeting medium to large ungulates.  Historically widespread across Africa and Eurasia, lion populations have drastically declined and are now fragmented, primarily due to habitat loss and human conflict.  They are currently listed as Vulnerable.

2. **Fact:**  Lions are more active during the day (diurnal) than other wild cats, but can adapt to being active at night or twilight if facing threats or persecution.",2025-03-01 20:58:45.523328
